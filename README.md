# Monument

> Memories...you're talking about memories.

[Monument](http://monument.mikejanger.net) is a web app where visitors tie memories to the places they've been.

## Why?

- To have a place to write short notes about memories I've made at places I've been to.
- To learn Go web programming using the [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) framework.
